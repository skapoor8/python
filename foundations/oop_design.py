    Purpose:    Explore the fundamentals of OO design in python

    Fundamental Questions:
    1.  What are OO design conventions in python?
    2.  What are the expected interface patterns for pythonic classes/modules?
        How are data structures expected to behave? What exceptions are they
        supposed to raise? 
    3.  How do class/module writers convey the behavior of their classes? i.e.
        documentation standards OR how do authors convey messageslike "this 
        function returns -1 on failure or raises XYZError." This is probably
        a symptom of bad design.
    4.  When is it appropriate to use user defined exceptions?
    5.  When to use predfined class functions, and when to directly work with
        the implementation? Single point of truth vs. performance.
